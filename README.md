Welcome to my Smart Contract focussed repo!

I am an experienced Smart Contract Developer and Auditor who has spent the last 10 years working in the Blockchain industry. 

I wanted to offer my knowledge and expertise in this field, as vast as it is, and try to decipher the most basic usages of smart contracts, all the way to the most complex and convoluted. 

I am creating several wiki pages and will open up various discussions for the community to engage with.

I am by no means a "maximalist". By that, I am strictly a Blockchain advocate. I do not believe one coin or chain rules them all.

I am very passionate about Ravencoin, Bitcoin, Litecoin, ZCash, Monero, Ethereum, Avalanche, Fantom and so on...

I appreciate the underlying technologies that programatically form the base of these great ecosystems and i encourage everyone to dive deep into each to understand their capabilities and problems they are trying to solve.

Please feel free to connect with me on my Twitter page and LinkedIn.
